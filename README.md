- **Interactive Dashboard**: Offers a dynamic and engaging user experience with slicers, filters, and drill-down options.
- **Changing Car Brand Logos**: Automatically updates car brand logos based on the selected manufacturer.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Implemented unique visuals and graphs to enhance the presentation of data.
- **Graphs and Charts**: Includes a variety of graphs such as depreciation analysis, sales trends, and KPI indicators for total revenue.
- **Custom Tooltips**: Integrated informative tooltips to provide additional context when hovering over data points.
- **DAX Calculations**: Leveraged DAX functions for calculating outputs like total revenue, driving range, depreciation, etc.
- **Geographic Mapping**: Visualized origin countries for car models using map charts.
- **Multi-Page Layout**: Organized information across multiple pages to separate manufacturer and model details.
- **Custom Backgrounds**: Designed and applied unique background templates to maintain a consistent and professional theme.

## Visualizations
The dashboard includes:
- **Depreciation Graph**: Illustrates the value drop of car models over time.
- **Sales Trends**: Displays sales performance across different periods.
- **Total Revenue KPI**: Highlights the total revenue generated by each brand.
